# Learning Portrait

Simple. Flexible. Empowering.

A grade book that thinks like you do.

Learning Portrait was built from the ground up to think like, and support, the classrooms of the most progressive K-12 educators – allowing educators, students, families and school systems to finally monitor learning in a way that makes sense.  Students aren’t numbers. They are learners. See the portrait of what they can do.
