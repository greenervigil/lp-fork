/**
 * Log Level order from the docs https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan#level-suggestions:
 *
 * The log levels in bunyan are as follows. The level descriptions are best practice opinions of the author.
 *
 * - "fatal" (60): The service/app is going to stop or become unusable now. An operator should definitely look into this soon.
 * - "error" (50): Fatal for a particular request, but the service/app continues servicing other requests. An operator should look at this soon(ish).
 * - "warn" (40): A note on something that should probably be looked at by an operator eventually.
 * - "info" (30): Detail on regular operation.
 * - "debug" (20): Anything else, i.e. too verbose to be included in "info" level.
 * - "trace" (10): Logging from external libraries used by your app or very detailed application logging.
 *
